Working with Unity Test Tools:
- Install Unity Test Tools from assets store or from https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13802 
- Use NUnity to create tests (See example to Level class: Soomla/Editor/UnitTest/LevelTest.cs)
- Run the tests: Open Unit Test Tool (menu bar, should be added after adding the asset from step 1), and choose Unit Test Runner. Select the test you wish to execute and press play.
